Program Assignment 2

HOW TO RUN PROGRAM:

If you wish to insert a .txt file for code, please put in format as follows
id neighbor cost
...
...
...
id neighbor cost
IMPORTANT!
Please insert the input file in the same folder where the src folder is, otherwise the program will crash.

To begin running the code, the main driver is in the Main.java class. When you run the file, a GUI will appear.
Select File, Load and search for the folder containing the src folder. Once you select the File you have 2 choices:
Run Distance Vector Routing -- runs iteration by iteration step at a time
Run Completely -- runs completely and displays the time

Notice that you cannot click these buttons until an input file has been loaded.


OBSERVATIONS:
As I run through the observation, I can see how each grid runs and updates the values based on shortest path.
the values are being updated until there is a stable state. Once the stable state has been reached, there is no more
need to update the tables

When I just run the grid completely, I can see the processing speed it takes for the algorithm to reach a stable state
with the nodes. For me, it is roughly 12-13 ms in order for the Distance Vector Routing algorithm to reach a stable
state.
